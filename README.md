# Out of process Mock

## Purpose

Provide a mechanism for external test clients to setup a mock such that when the
test client calls the service, the service will use the mock instead of the
intended target. Commonly used to mock out dependencies of the service under
test.

## Process

At its core, OopMock gets the signature of the method being mocked via the
class/method name, with the arguments as the discriminator. If it finds a match
of that signature/discriminator, it will convert stored data and return the
response. In the event they are not found, it will simply call the method.

The intent is that this can be extended to OpenAPI clients, OpenFeign or other
clients so that this can be invisible to the user of the library. But this
provides the basic building blocks.

**Caveat**: The default behavior shown here requires the test client to have the
class model of the server. Extensions to OopMock will remove this requirement.

The server code that needs to be mocked is instrumented with the OopMock proxy.
Example

Before:

```java
public String getInternalData(String id) {
    final String request = "/v1/dataset/" + id;
    final Response r = client.call(request);
    return r.getData();
}
```

After

```java
private final OopMock oopMock = oopMockFactory.generate(getClass());
public String getInternalData(String id) {
    return oopMock.proxy(String.class, () ->{
            final String request = "/v1/dataset/"+id;
            final Response rdf = client.call(request);
            return r.getData();
          },"getInternalData",id);
}
```

Client code can then setup the proxy:

```java
final String mockResult = "Something wicked this way comes";
final OopMockClient mock = oppMockClientFactory.generate(ServerClass.class);
mock.setup(mock.hash("getInternalData","55432"), mockResult);
final ServerResult result = server.call("id:55432");
assertThat(result.getData()).isEqualTo(mockResult);
```

## Creating Factories

OopMockFactory and OopMockClientFactory are thread-safe instances that can be
reused and treated like singletons. You should inject them with the IoC
framework of your choice.

They are built using the OopMockFactoryBuilder (or OopMockClientFactoryBuilder)
with the same parameters. (For simplicity, I'll just review the
OopMockFactoryBuilder going forward, but the rules apply for both.)

To function, you need a configuration file in your classpath named
oopMockConfiguration.json that at a minimum states that the OomMock is enabled,
like so:

```json
{
  "enabled": "true"
}
```

If no file exists, OopMock will run in disabled mode. There is virtual no impact
to runtime performance of your server when it is disabled. When enabled, it
requires the setting of a resolver (like oop-mock-dynamodb) which will require
at least updates to the configuration file.
(Check your resolver for how to use)

Out of the box, OopMock provides the ability for an InMemory resolver, and no
client is used. This can be useful if you have static data you want for mocks
that never changes. To use the InMemory resolver, your configuration file would
look like this:

```json
{
  "enabled": "true",
  "mockDataFileName": "testData.json"
}
```

Where testData.json is the test data itself. (See the InMemory format for
details)

## Namespace

Any Resolver Datastore (InMemory, DynamoDB, JDBC, etc) can contain data needed
for multiple servers. Every Mock request has a 'namespace' associated with it.
By default, it's set to ```DEFAULT```

You can set the namespace in your configuration file instead. It's recommended
to leave it and only set it when you need multiple namespaces.

```json
{
  "enabled": "true",
  "mockDataFileName": "testData.json",
  "namespace": "My Application"
}
```

## FAQ

### Is the mocked code executed in production environments?

The intent is for the default behavior to provide a pass-thru for the client. To
enable the OopMock framework, the factory must be provided the appropriate
argument on creation. By default, it's disabled. Your runtime environment should
enable this argument the same way it enables debugging ports.

### What is the increased latency for the pass thru mode?

In pass thru mode, the framework is disabled and there is no latency impact.
